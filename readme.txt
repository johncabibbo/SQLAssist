   Setup:
   SQL Assist requires a Apache 2.0 or newer, PHP 5.5 or newer and MySQL 5.6 or newer.

   Place the SQLAssist directory within any web accessible directory.
   
   Configure the settings in the db.php file.
   
      The MySQL user does not need to be root but does require read access to the information_schema database.

      
   That's it!
